                <h3>1. What is vector art and why is it used widely in both screen and print?</h3>
                <p>Vector art is a type of digital graphic that uses mathematical equations to create images, rather than pixels. This allows the image to be scaled infinitely without loss of quality, which makes it ideal for both screen and print formats.</p>

                <h3>2. What are the benefits of using Adobe Illustrator to create digital images?</h3>
                <p>Adobe Illustrator is widely used because it provides powerful tools for creating precise, scalable vector graphics. It offers flexibility in terms of editing, advanced color controls, and integration with other Adobe tools.</p>

                <h3>3. Tools Explanation: Pen, Brush, and Pencil</h3>
