                <h2>1. What is Vector Art and Why is it Used Widely in Both Screen and Print?</h2>
                <p>
                    Vector art is a type of digital image created using mathematical formulas to define shapes like
                    lines, curves, and polygons. Unlike raster images, which are composed of pixels, vector images are
                    resolution-independent, meaning they can be scaled to any size without losing quality. This makes
                    vector art ideal for both screen and print applications, ensuring sharp and clean images at any
                    size.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Why is vector art so widely used?</strong></p>
