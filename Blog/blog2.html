                <h2>What is copyright?</h2>
                <p>
                    Copyright is a legal right that grants the creator of an original work exclusive control over how it
                    is used, distributed, and reproduced. This applies to a wide range of creative works, including
                    literature, art, music, film, and images. Copyright ensures that creators are recognized and
                    compensated for their work, while protecting their intellectual property from unauthorized use.
                </p>

                <h2>Why do we have copyright laws?</h2>
                <p>
                    Copyright laws exist to protect creators' rights and incentivize creativity by providing legal
                    frameworks that ensure they benefit from their work. These laws encourage innovation and creativity
                    by giving creators control over their intellectual property, while also balancing public access to
                    creative works.
                </p>

                <h2>How long does copyright last?</h2>
                <p>
                    The duration of copyright protection varies by country, but generally, it lasts for the lifetime of
                    the creator plus an additional 50 to 70 years after their death. In many countries, including the
                    U.S. and the EU, this period is 70 years after the creator’s death. For works created by
                    corporations or anonymously, copyright typically lasts for 95 to 120 years from publication,
                    depending on the jurisdiction.
                </p>

                <h2>What will happen if you break copyright laws?</h2>
                <p>
                    Breaking copyright laws can lead to serious consequences, including legal action. Penalties for
                    copyright infringement can include fines, removal of the infringing material, and in severe cases,
                    imprisonment. Additionally, the infringer may be required to compensate the copyright holder for any
                    financial losses incurred as a result of the unauthorized use.
                </p>

                <h2>Examples of Copyright Infringement</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Case 1: Shepard Fairey and the Obama "Hope" Poster</strong>
                        In 2009, artist Shepard Fairey was sued for copyright infringement by the Associated Press (AP)
                        for using one of their photos as the basis for his famous "Hope" poster during Barack Obama’s
                        2008 presidential campaign. The lawsuit ended in a settlement where Fairey agreed to pay a fine
                        and share the rights to the image with the AP.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Case 2: Vanilla Ice and "Ice Ice Baby"</strong>
                        In the early 1990s, rapper Vanilla Ice was sued by the rock band Queen and David Bowie for
                        copying the bassline from their song "Under Pressure" in his hit "Ice Ice Baby" without
                        permission. The case was settled out of court, with Vanilla Ice agreeing to pay a financial
                        settlement and credit the original songwriters.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>What percentage of a copyrighted image are you legally allowed to use?</h2>
                <p>
                    There is no fixed percentage of a copyrighted image that you are legally allowed to use in your
                    artwork. Fair use laws in many countries allow limited use of copyrighted material for purposes like
                    education, commentary, or parody, but these laws are complex and context-dependent. Using any part
                    of a copyrighted image without permission may still constitute infringement if it negatively affects
                    the original work or the market for it.
                </p>

                <h2>What are moral rights?</h2>
                <p>
                    Moral rights refer to the personal rights of creators to protect the integrity of their work and be
                    properly credited for it. These rights ensure that an artist's work is not altered or used in a way
                    that could harm their reputation. Moral rights typically include the right to attribution (being
                    recognized as the creator) and the right to object to derogatory treatment of the work.
                </p>

                <h2>How can you assert your copyright and moral rights?</h2>
                <p>
                    To assert your copyright, you should clearly indicate that your work is protected by copyright,
                    usually by including a copyright symbol (©), your name, and the date of creation on your artwork.
                    You can also register your work with a copyright office to strengthen legal protection. To assert
                    your moral rights, make sure your name is associated with your work and state your preferences about
                    how your work should be treated or modified in any publishing agreement.
